# Woof! 



Welcome to our Dog Sitter application! This project is built with Java and follows the Modern Android Development practices, making use of Fragments and CallBacks to provide a smooth and responsive user experience.

Our app features Auntification and Registration with Firebase, allowing users to securely create and manage their accounts. All user data is stored in Firebase RealTime DB, ensuring reliable and consistent data access. Additionally, we leverage Firebase Storage to store all images, enabling fast and efficient image loading.

Forgot Password functionality is also included, enabling users to easily reset their password in case they forget it. An Image Carousel lets users quickly browse through images, while a Favourite List allows them to easily save and manage their favorite items.

Users can update their profile information at any time, ensuring that their data is always up to date. We also provide Phone call integration, making it easy for users to directly call relevant contacts. Furthermore, we offer integration with popular messaging apps like Whatsapp, Telegram, and Facebook, providing seamless communication between users and service providers.

Overall, our Dog Sitter application provides a complete solution for managing dog sitting services, with a modern architecture and powerful features. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed building it!
